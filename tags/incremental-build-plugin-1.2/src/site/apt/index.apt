 Overview
 
   The Maven Incremental Build plugin is a plugin that enable maven to recompile only what it have to when you call mvn compile (It is not necessary to call clean phase now).
   
Goals Overview
 
  The Maven Incremental Build Plugin is a part of the build process, so it is not necessary to have a particulary goal to call it outside the build process.
