<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />Maven incremental build plugin enables maven2 to realize incremental builds on multi-modules projects. With this plugin in the parent pom, the modules with modification and their dependencies will be clean before any action. No needs to call mvn clean compile which recompile modules with no modification too. See the <a title="maven generated site" href="https://maven-incremental-build.dev.java.net/alm-process/maven/index.html">maven generated site</a>  for details.
